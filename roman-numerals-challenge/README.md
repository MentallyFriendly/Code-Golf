# Code-golf challenge: 28th June '17Â 

## Roman-numerals to numbers

Write a program that given Roman-numerals outputs their numerical value.

The program can be written in a language of your choice.

Code will be measured on perfomance and character count. 

A sample of small and large roman-numerals will be tested.

Testing to be on the same machine.

Example values:

Roman-numeral | Numerical value
--- | ---
VI | 4
XII | 12
XVI | 16
XXVIII | 28
XL | 40
XLI | 41
LXIV | 64
XC | 90
XCIX | 99
CCC | 300
M | 1000
MCMXCII | 1992  
  

### Some History 

>The history of Roman numerals follows the history of ancient Rome itself,
>from its beginnings at the Latin Palatine Hill in 8th and 9th century B.C.
>to it's fall in the 2nd Century AD from civil war, plague, civil apathy and the rise of Christianity and northern European powers.
>
>The Roman empire had inspirational, industrious and intellectual beginnings however,
>however their number system was flawed, it had no zero (0), and no single method for counting above several thousand units, (lines were often placed over numerals to indicate multiples of their value). 
>
>The eventual fall of the Roman Empire by 300 A.D. saw the introduction and adoption of Arabic numerals, today we call them decimal numbers because they work consistently to a base of 10. The invention of zero (nothing) was a huge leap forward.
