# Roman Swift & Kotlin

Converts a Roman numeral to an integer, in Swift and Kotlin. Both scrips have the same approach, just replacing the characters by the values and then adding everything acording to the roman's logic.

A lot of characters where used in the making of these programs.

Run Swift:
```Swift
swift roman.swift MCMLXXXIV
```

Run Kotlin:
```Kotlin
kotlinc -script roman.kts MCMLXXXIV
```

### Where the heck is Swift?

You will need to have XCode installed. After installing XCode and the developer tools that come with it, swift should be available in the command line.

### Kotlin???

You probably need to run these commands before magic happens.
```sh
brew update
brew install kotlin
```
