## Fibonacci sequence

Write a program that determines if a given number lies within the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

The program can be written in a language of your choice.

The program must return **true** if the number is a Fibonacci number, and **false** if it is not.

The program performance will be measured across a sample of sample of small, large and very large numbers.

Sample of **TRUE** numbers
5, 8, 21, 233, 610, 2584, 6765, 10946, 5702887, 63245986, 1548008755920, 16130531424904581415797907386349, 222232244629420445529739893461909967206666939096499764990979600,

Testing will be on machine using the _time_ command.
