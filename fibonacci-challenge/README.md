## Fibonacci sequence

Write a program that determines if a given number lies within the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

The program can be written in a language of your choice.

The program must return **true** if the number is a Fibonacci number, and **false** if it is not.

The program performance will be measured across a sample of sample of small, large and very large numbers.

Testing will be on the same machine using the _time_ command.
