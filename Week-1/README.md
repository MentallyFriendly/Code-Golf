# Week 1

You must write a program to evaluate a string that would be entered into a calculator.
The program must accept a string input and output the correct answer.
For example; a user enters a string in the form 2PLUS3 and we get output 5
Aim to support at least the PLUS, MINUS, TIMES, and DIVIDE operators.
You may use any language you choose. The code may be minified but not compiled (i.e. source code).
You can assume that the input is valid and follows the correct format (i.e. no error handling required).
Bonus points
Code is still readable
Can handle floating point and negative numbers
Follows order of operations
Does not use any kind of "eval" functions
Gracefully handles errors (like "divide by zero")
Example Cases
Input: 1PLUS1
Output: 2
Input: 2PLUS12MINUS3
Output: 11
Input: 20TIMES3
Output: 60
Input: 30DIVIDE2
Output: 15
